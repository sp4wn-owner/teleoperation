VR teleoperation platform for advanced robots. We handle all the networking, security, and authentication so you can quickly start teleoperating your robot or device within minutes.

### Getting started
Please refer to the Robots directory for setup instructions.

## Key features
- Real-time control  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Experience ultra-low latency enabling near real-time control over the internet via direct peer-to-peer connections. 

- Secure  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Optionally handle your robot's security. Passwords/codes are securely hashed and all data is encrypted. No personal information is requested nor retained. Update the security parameters in the config.js file.

- Token system (cryptocurrency)  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Transform your robots into revenue-generating assets or pay users for controlling them. Setting your robot's token rate to a negative number will deduct tokens from your account to the user while a positive token rate will deduct tokens from the user to your account. Setting the token rate to zero will enable free access. Our system functions similar to a centralized exchange with automatic deposits and withdrawals.

- Public/private access  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Share your robot with the world, add a secret code for authenticated access, and toggle visibility in our live feed. Robots removed from the live feed can still be accessed at sp4wn.com/[username]. Following the robot (clicking the star icon) will include it in your feed regardless of visibility, enabling a customizable feed of both public and personal robots.

- Easy integration  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We provide all the code necessary to connect your robot to our platform. However, you will be required to build/update the middleware (vrHandler) that controls the robot. Please refer to our examples or reach out to us for assistance.
