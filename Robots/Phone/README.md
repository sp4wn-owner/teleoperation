## Phone Robot:

### Hardware (Phone + ESP32)
- Mobile phone
- ESP32 WROOM 32D microcontroller
- Robot chassis (You can find a cheap robot chassis on Aliexpress/Amazon/eBay or 3D print your own)
- L293D or another motor driver
- Breadboard
- Phone mount (1/4-20 x 3/4" Truss Head Machine Screws + 1/4-20 Inch Wingnuts) [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/335118194262)
- Battery or power supply with respective connectors (I'm using a USB breakout to power the motors from the battery)
- Breadboard jumper wires 
- Soldering iron (If you'd like to fuse the wires to the motor connectors so they don't disconnect)

### Step 1
- Flash ESP32 using the Arduino IDE with respective code (ESP32_BLE_Dev_Module) from our [github](https://github.com/sp4wn-owner/teleoperation/blob/main/Robots/Phone/ESP32_BLE_Dev_Module/ESP32_BLE_Dev_Module.ino)
- If this is your first time using the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE, you'll need to add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json to additional boards manager (file > preferences)
- To flash this board you may need to update your USB driver (see file). Then select board (Tools > Board > esp32 > ESP Dev Module).

### Step 2
- Connect all wires and secure phone mount
- On the Spawn website under profile, click "Go Live" then click "Connect". Your robot should pop up on your list of Bluetooth devices. Once connected, test using the controls.

### Tips
- Edit the code and make your robot do whatever you want when it receives certain messages.
- If Bluetooth is not enabled you will need to go to chrome://flags to enable it
